# RotMG_Clientless

This is a project i have started just for my own enjoyment. I will be updating this repo as progress is made. 

02/10/2017 - Github repo created and project pushed, almost all inbound packet classes are finished at this point.
             Some of the core code will most likely be changing, i plan to make each "Client" class handle its own
             socket connection. That would allow 1 program to run multiple bots. I will keep this log updated with
             the latest changes and misc plans.
